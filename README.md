My reading journal for Code Fellows

* **My name is Ryan Gosselin**, I am here to learn C# and start a career relating to UX/UI development and/or game developement. I served in the US Army Reserve for 10 years and deployed once. I learned communications in the Army but have always been interested in computers and games. I am motivated by my smart, kind, and beautiful wife and GSP puppy named Momo(Named after Avatar the Last Airbender's lemur).

* **Growth mindset** is something that is becoming mandatory in most professions as we move deeper into the information age. Information is readily available, at all times, so society is finally pushing for a more complete transition to a life of learning instead of simply becoming skilled at a trade by mastering it and learning what you choose to.

## Reminders to stay in a growth mindset

* Knowledge is _infinite_
  * New is **_interesting_**
    * > "The more you **know**, the more you know you **don't** know."
