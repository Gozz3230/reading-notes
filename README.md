My reading journal for Code Fellows

My name is Ryan Gosselin, I am here to learn C# and start a career relating to UX/UI development and/or game developement. I served in the US Army Reserve for 10 years and deployed once. I learned communications in the Army but have always been interested in computers and games. I am motivated by my smart, kind, and beautiful wife and GSP puppy named Momo(Namedafter Avatar the Last Airbender's lemur).

Growth mindset is something that is becoming mandatory in most professions as we move deeper into the information age. Information is readily available, at all times, so society is finally pushing for a more complete transition to a life of learning instead of simply becoming skilled at a trade by mastering it and learning what you choose to.

## Reminders to stay in a growth mindset

* Knowledge is _infinite_
  * New is **_interesting_**
  * > "The more you **know**, the more you know you **don't** know."
