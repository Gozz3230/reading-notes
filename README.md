My reading journal for Code Fellows

My name is Ryan

Growth mindset is something that is becoming mandatory in most professions as we move deeper into the information age. Information is readily available, at all times, so society is finally pushing for a more complete transition to a life of learning instead of simply becoming skilled at a trade by mastering it and learning what you choose to.

## Reminders to stay in a growth mindset

- Knowledge is infinite
- The more you know, the more you know you don't know
- New is interesting
