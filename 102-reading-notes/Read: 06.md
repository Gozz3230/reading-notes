Javascript and Java are not the same. I will be referring to Javascript only, which is used for web page actions when supporting HTML and CSS. Once the backbone(HTML) and color/alignment(CSS) is put together, you then need the vital organs(javascript) to really complete a web page. Javascript can be 'embeded' or 'included' in an HTML file. 

If you embed Javascript directly inside the HTML file, everything is visible on the same page, but also adds clutter. If you include Javascript in an HTML file, the only thing you see is a line in the HTML file that includes the external Javascript file. This links the two files so the Javascript can take affect. To embed Javascript in the HTML file we use opening tag ```<script>``` and closing tag ```</script>```. Example shown below:

```
    <script language="javascript">
 
    alert("Hello World");

    </script>
 ```
