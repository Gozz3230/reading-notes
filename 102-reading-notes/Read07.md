Control Flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script
Control Flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

A Javascript funtion is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. It is executed when 'something' invokes it(calls it).
    * When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
    * When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
    * Automatically (self invoked)

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
    * Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
    *Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
    *Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

Types of Javascript Operators - 
    * Arithmetic Operators
    * Assignment Operators
    * Comparison Operators
    * Logical Operators
    * Conditional Operators
    * Type Operators

Other Vocab:
    *Function return
    *Return value - returned back to the 'caller'
    *Local Variables - can only be accesses from within the function. Same name can be used in different functions because local variables are only looked at/recognized in their function.
    *Assignment Operator - assigns a value to a variable
    *Addition Assignment Operator - adds a value to a variable.
