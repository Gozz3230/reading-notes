> HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.

There are many elements to change how the website is structured. There are tags to perform what can be done in Markdown. There are a lot more options in HTML, however.

Elements can be nested/placed within other elements. This is useful to put more than one affect on an item.

Void elements do not use a closing tag. All content is withing one tage. and example is the `<img/>` tag

Anatomy of an HTML document:


```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" />
  </body>
</html>
```

**Semantics** of code have more to do with the purpose of the element rather than what it looks like.
