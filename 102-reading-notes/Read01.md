Markdown syntax is easier than HTML syntax since it seems to have less options. There are some key differences so this page comes in handy.

[Markdown Syntax Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

This guide compares Markdown tags to HTML tags, which is even more helpful.

You can have headings, paragraphs, line breaks, bold italic, quotes of literature, can nest these quotes. You can have ordered lists, undordered lists, images, and you can even quote code. Don't worry if you don't understand all of these terms. Simply go to the markdown guide and skim over them to see what it is that they do.

GitHub pages is a great way to collaborat on code. You can make your code public and have public facing websites. Every commit is saved as a version, so you can always go back to old copies. The workflow for GitHub pages is amazing.
