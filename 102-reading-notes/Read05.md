HTML is the backbone of a website. Once you have it in place, it may not look pretty, but it's sturdy. That's where CSS comes in. CSS adds the pretty features and the muscles and connective tissue that keeps the spine where it is needed. On a website, this means CSS will center images, add color, align text, and many more helpful things for visual affect.


    '''h1 {
        color: red;
        font-size: 5em;
    }'''


Above is an example of a CSS rule. CSS is a rule based language. This specific rule will make h1 elements(heading 1) red in color and 5em in font size. 'color' and 'font-size' are CSS properties. These properties have different allowable values depending on their purpose.

HTML, CSS, and Javascript are defined in online documents known as 'specifications.' This is a great place to go for in depth knowledge, however, many developers prefer referencing MDN(Mozilla Developer Network) documentation or other learning resources.
