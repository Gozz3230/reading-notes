**Snapshots:** Git is a file system made up of snapshots. Each commit/save is stored so you can reference it later.

**Local Operations:** Git relies on users to store things locally when working on them so there is no need to fetch history information from the server. This allows work to be done offline.

**Tracking Changes:** All changes are tracked in Git. Git also detects file corruption or loss of information in transit.

**Loss of Data:** Git minimalizes the possibility of irreversible damage to files. Snapshots are protected very well.

**States:** There are three file states in Git; *committed, modified, and staged.*

> Modified means the file has been changed but not committed to the database.

> Staged means it is ready to be committed.

> Committed means data is securely stored in a local database.
