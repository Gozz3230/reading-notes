- CSS is used to align elements of html and add color and style. Makes a website from the 1999 look modern.

### 2.
- Inline styles are sometimes good for testing purposes since they take first priority over references. This same feature means it is bad practice to use them since anything that's referenced will likely be interfered with. Keeping a reference file for CSS not only solves this, but it makes work easier. You can references many elements such as a p or section element and give them all the same style. If you use inline CSS you have to write a line for every single one.
